This is my solution to **Homework 1**:

``` r
library(tidyverse)
```

## Problem 1

Create a data frame with the specified elements.

``` r
Prob1_df =
  tibble(
    samp = rnorm(10),
    samp_gt_0 = samp > 0,
    char_vec = c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j"),
    factor_vec = c("low", "low", "low", "mod", "mod", "mod", "mod", "high", "high", "high")
)
```

Take the mean of each variable in my data frame.

``` r
mean(pull(Prob1_df, samp))
## [1] -0.8107876
mean(pull(Prob1_df, samp_gt_0))
## [1] 0.2
mean(pull(Prob1_df, char_vec))
## Warning in mean.default(pull(Prob1_df, char_vec)): argument is not numeric or
## logical: returning NA
## [1] NA
mean(pull(Prob1_df, factor_vec))
## Warning in mean.default(pull(Prob1_df, factor_vec)): argument is not numeric or
## logical: returning NA
## [1] NA
```

I am able to take the mean of numbers/logical vectors but not
characters/factors.

``` r
as.numeric(pull(Prob1_df, samp_gt_0))
as.numeric(pull(Prob1_df, char_vec))
as.numeric(pull(Prob1_df, factor_vec))
```

The above function is able to convert the logical variable to values of
0 and 1, however, it resulted in vectors of NA for the character and
factor variables. This could be because R has no way of assigning
numeric values to character/factor values, therefore a mean of these
cannot be computed.

``` r
as.numeric(pull(Prob1_df, samp_gt_0)) * pull(Prob1_df, samp)
##  [1] 0.000000000 0.000000000 0.197958893 0.000000000 0.006027597 0.000000000
##  [7] 0.000000000 0.000000000 0.000000000 0.000000000
as.factor(pull(Prob1_df, samp_gt_0)) * pull(Prob1_df, samp)
## Warning in Ops.factor(as.factor(pull(Prob1_df, samp_gt_0)), pull(Prob1_df, : '*'
## not meaningful for factors
##  [1] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA
as.numeric(as.factor(pull(Prob1_df, samp_gt_0))) * pull(Prob1_df, samp)
##  [1] -0.45462393 -0.85103577  0.39591779 -0.63534838  0.01205519 -0.51489084
##  [7] -2.31198991 -2.20891809 -0.23151816 -1.10353748
```

Instead of converting the logical vector into a numeric with values of 0
and 1, I was able to first convert the logical vector into a factor, and
then the factor vector into a numeric, resulting in values of 1 and 2
for the original logical vector; giving more meaning to its scaling by
the sample.

## Problem 2

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
summary(penguins)
nrow(penguins)
ncol(penguins)
is.na(pull(penguins, flipper_length_mm))
na.omit(pull(penguins, flipper_length_mm))
mean(na.omit(pull(penguins, flipper_length_mm)))
```

The “penguins” data set is composed of variables for penguins living
near Palmer Station, Antarctica in 2007-2009 indicating their species,
island of residency, bill length (mm), bill depth (mm), flipper length
(mm), body mass (g), and sex. This data set has 344 rows and 8 columns.
The mean flipper length of penguins in this data set is 200.9152047 mm.

``` r
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, 
                     y = flipper_length_mm,
                     color = species)) + 
  geom_point()
```

![](p8105_hw1_dn2501_files/figure-gfm/plot%20of%20flipper%20length%20vs%20bill%20length-1.png)<!-- -->

``` r
ggsave("penguins_scatter_plot.pdf", height = 4, width = 6)
```

The above is a plot of flipper length (mm) vs bill length (mm) for the
penguins in the data set.
